NEMISIG (North East Music Information Special Interest Group) is a yearly informal meeting for Music Information Retrieval researchers who work at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and music.

For those familiar with the International Society of Music Information Retrieval ([ISMIR](http://ismir.net)), NEMISIG often serves as a mini-conference to informally discuss research progress a few months in advance of the submission deadline.

Recent incarnations of NEMISIG have also featured an open "jam session," since we're in it for the music, after all.

## Keen to help host a NEMISIG?

The workshop usually draws around 50 individuals and is meant to be completely **free**, with costs subsidized through University budgets, industry sponsorhip, or (ideally) both. The workshop is traditionally held at the end of January / beginning of February, and organization is usually discussed in October / November.
